# Dronesweetie
It’s a bird, it’s a plane...it's images of drones, as described by a computer. 

@dronesweetie is a Twitter bot that tweets computer-generated descriptions of images of drones. The bot is powered by the Toronto deep Learning image-to-text engine. I wrote a Python script to programmatically input the results of an image search for “drones” into the Toronto Deep learning machine vision tool, and then scrape the results to form the corpus for the Twitter bot. @dronesweetie is part of a larger exploration of image recognition and the poetic possibilities in machine vision, and failed translations between image and text.
